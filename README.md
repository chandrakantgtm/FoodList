# FoodList

React Native
Assignment duration: 2 hours 30 minutes
Requirement:
● Create a project that fetches JSON from the URL below:
https://api.jsonbin.io/b/5f2c36626f8e4e3faf2cb42e
● The project must include:
○ A launch button to present the model of “Approved Foods List”
○ The list should include:
- collapsible sections with categories and subcategories - a search bar that allows to filter out
the list items as per the entered keyword
○ Make sure that data is fetched from the network only once. You can persist data in local
storage of your choice.
○ Try to match the designs as per the attached mock-ups.
● Bonus Points
○ Write Tests
○ Animations
Notes:
1. You can ignore the food icons as the url in the “imagePath” of JSON will not be accessible to
you. Please use dummy images there.
2. Submit your application even if you couldn’t develop it completely. We want to evaluate how
you approach the problem.
3. Please host the assignment somewhere in a public repository and share the URL with us.
